This was the first time I took part in this CTF.  I think it has a lot to offer us newbies, and I enjoyed it a lot.  A lot of web application attack techniques were being tested. 


I unfortunately didn't have enough time to still create detailed instructions for each challenge we solved, but I'll try and upload as time goes on.
